# Scent Matters: Differential contribution of scent to insect response in flowers with insect vs. wind pollination traits

This repository accompanies the manuscript, 'Scent Matters: Differential contribution of scent to insect response in flowers with insect vs. wind pollination traits.' 

All material necessary to replicate Non-multidimensioanl Scaling (NMDS) Analysis, ANalysis Of SIMilarity (ANOSIM), test for Phylogenetic signal and ancestral state reconstruction of EAG from the manuscript are in this folder. 
- NMDS and ANOSIM were done in Matlab.
- Test for Phylogenetic Signal and Ancestral State Reconstruction of EAG were done in R. 

Scripts calls data from other folder in repository. If you'd like to run the scripts download the entire repositer and place it on your Desktop, otherwise edit the working directory. 

## Content of 'Thalictrum-Flora-Scent' folder
- Scripts folder with Matlab and R scripts. 
- FathomToolbox folder with relavant function to run Matlab. 
- data folder.
