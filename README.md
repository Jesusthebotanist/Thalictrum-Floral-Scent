# Scent Matters: Repeated loss of insect attraction by floral scent accompanies transitions to wind pollination

This repository accompanies the manuscript, 'Scent Matters: Repeated loss of insect attraction by floral scent accompanies transitions to wind pollination.' 

DoAll material necessary to replicate Non-multidimensioanl Scaling (NMDS) Analysis, ANalysis Of SIMilarity (ANOSIM), test for Phylogenetic signal and ancestral state reconstruction of EAG from the manuscript are in this folder. 
- NMDS and ANOSIM were performed in Matlab.
- Test for PHylogenetic Signal and Ancestrl State Reconstruction of EAG were done in R. 

Scripts call data within all other folder, they should all if you place entire repository on Desktop. Otherwise change working directory. 

## Content of 'ThalictrumScent' folder
- Scripts folder with Matlab and R scripts. 
- FathomToolbox folder with relavant function to run Matlab. 
- data folder with dat.
